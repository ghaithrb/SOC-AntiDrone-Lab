# SOC Laboratory – Anti‑Drone Security Platform (Educational Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository presents a **complete Security Operations Center (SOC) laboratory** designed and implemented as part of a **Final Year Engineering Project (PFE)**. The project focuses on **network defense, intrusion detection, threat monitoring, and attack simulation**, with a particular emphasis on **anti‑drone security concepts** within a controlled and virtualized environment.

The lab is fully simulated using **GNS3**, **Linux servers**, **firewalls**, **IDS/IPS systems**, **honeypots**, and **Dockerized vulnerable services**. All configurations are documented in a **safe, sanitized, and non‑deployable manner**, following professional SOC documentation standards.

⚠️ **Important**: This repository does NOT contain real credentials, production IP addresses, or sensitive operational data.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Design a realistic SOC network architecture
* Implement network segmentation and perimeter security
* Deploy IDS/IPS solutions for threat detection
* Simulate cyber‑attacks to validate detection mechanisms
* Centralize monitoring and analysis
* Apply ethical and academic cybersecurity practices

---

## 🧱 Global Architecture

### 🔹 Network Zones

The SOC architecture is based on a **multi‑zone security model**:

* **WAN**: Simulated external network / attacker side
* **DMZ**: Public‑facing services and sensors
* **LAN**: Internal secured network
* **SOC Zone**: Monitoring and analysis systems
* **GUEST Zone**: Isolated untrusted network

### 🔹 Core Components

* **pfSense Firewall** – Network segmentation, filtering, NAT
* **Snort IDS** – Network intrusion detection
* **Suricata IPS** – Real‑time traffic inspection
* **Cowrie Honeypot** – Attacker behavior analysis
* **Docker Services** – DVWA, OpenVAS
* **Kali Linux** – Attack simulation
* **Ubuntu Servers** – Sensors & services

## 🖥 Virtualization & Simulation

### GNS3 Usage

The entire SOC lab is implemented in **GNS3**, allowing:

* Realistic network topology simulation
* Integration of virtual machines and Docker containers
* Controlled attack and defense scenarios

Topology diagrams and screenshots are available in the `architecture/` directory.

## 🔍 Attack Simulation Methodology

Attacks are simulated in a **controlled environment** to validate SOC capabilities.

Examples:

* Network scanning (reconnaissance)
* Web application attacks
* Unauthorized access attempts

All attack descriptions are **high‑level** and do not include


🛡 Detection & Response

IDS alerts generated by Snort & Suricata

Firewall blocking policies validated

Honeypot logs analyzed for attacker behavior

Security events documented in SOC context

🔐 Security & Ethics

No real IP addresses or credentials

No production‑ready exploits

Academic and ethical cybersecurity usage

Documentation‑only configurations
